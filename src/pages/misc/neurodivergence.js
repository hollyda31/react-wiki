        <p>
          Do you have a mental illness or neurodivergency? Have you ever been
          told that you can overcome your mental illness with positive thinking,
          essential oils, more vegetables, weight loss, or some other bullshit?
        </p>
        <p>
          So here's the thing... Neurodivergency literally means that your brain
          is structurally different from a neurotypical brain. If they stuck you
          inside an MRI, they could SEE the difference in the thickness of your
          cortices in various areas of your brain.
        </p>

          But this is something we often overlook, because most of these
          conditions aren't diagnosed with an MRI. They're diagnosed with
          questionnaires and interviews, because MRIs are expensive. Also, the
          difference in cortical measurements are often very small and require
          very precise MRIs, something that can be difficult to measure in a
          living person who breathes (and thus, can't keep 100% stationary
          during an MRI). So we use our mouths and we talk, but that doesn't
          mean that our brains aren't structurally different.

          Now the people that made up these pretty drawings - this ENIGMA
          Consortium, which is made up of an international group who's been
          gathering this research for a long time - they've also found that
          different medications can actually CHANGE this whole cortical
          thickness thing. For example, the group studying Bipolar Disorder is
          the Bipolar Disorder (BD) Working Group, which consists of "an
          international team of over 150 clinicians, neuroscientists,
          bioengineers, and geneticists who pool research resources from 20
          countries and 55 institutions to conduct large-scale neuroimaging
          studies of BD. The group has combined multimodal neuroimaging data
          from 46 study cohorts which include ~3,500 BD participants and ~ 8,500
          healthy controls, making it the largest neuroimaging consortium effort
          to study BD."
        </p>
        <h2 id="bipolar">Bipolar Disorder</h2>
        <p>The ENIGMA BD Working Group says:</p>
        <p>
          "With regard to medication status, we found significantly higher
          cortical thickness in participants with BD also taking lithium at the
          time of scan, with the largest effects in the left paracentral gyrus.
          Anticonvulsant treatment was associated with lower cortical thickness,
          with the greatest effects in bilateral occipital gyri. Atypical
          “second-generation” antipsychotics were associated with lower cortical
          surface area in the rostral middle frontal gyrus, whereas typical
          “first-generation” antipsychotics were associated with higher surface
          area in the left inferior parietal gyrus."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I don't understand all of that. But what I DO understand is that
          taking your meds actually changes the physical structure of your
          brain. Like, this can be visualized on brain imaging. In the next
          paragraph, they say, "Structural deficits in these regions have been
          tied to disruptions in sensorimotor integration (Caspers, Zilles,
          Laird, & Eickhoff, 2010) and language (Vigneau et al., 2006), and may
          relate to altered emotion perception and rapid mood changes in BD."
        </p>
        <p>So, to review... if you have Bipolar, this study says:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your brain is structurally different than someone who does not have
            Bipolar.
          </li>
          <li>Taking your meds changes your brain to make it more "normal".</li>
          <li>
            The areas of your brain that are different are areas responsible for
            language and "sensorimotor integration". Sensorimotor integration
            means that you can sense something and translate that into a motor
            action, like you feel heat from a stove and jerk your hand away.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you're not on your meds, your brain gives you "altered emotion
            perception", which means that you're not able to accurately assess
            your own emotional state. The meds fix this part of the brain, which
            helps to stabilize mood changes and fix rapid cycling.
